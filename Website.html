<h1>About Me</h1>

Hi, I'm Jordan, a fourth year mathematics undergraduate at The University of Glasgow. 
The aim of this website is to compile resources and problems which I find interesting.

<h1>Current Research</h1>
This summer (2022) I was fortunate enough to receive funding for a Carnegie Vacation Scholarship. I am working on a project entitled 'Geometric Invariant Theory' with <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/christopherathorne/">Dr Christopher Athorne</a>.
